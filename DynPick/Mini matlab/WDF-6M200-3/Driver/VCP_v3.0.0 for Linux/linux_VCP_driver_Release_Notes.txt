Driver Installation
-------------------

	1. Extract the source package into the home directory by running:
		gzip -cd cp210x-x.y.z-i.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	
	2. Modify line 17 of the ./cp210x/Rules.make file to set KENELDIR to point to 
	the local source directory. (2.4 kernel only)
	
	3. Modify line 98 of the ./cp210x/cp210x.h file to set the include directory to
	point to the local source directory's copy of usb-serial.h. (2.4 kernel only)
	
	4. Use the following command to build the rpm:
		./makerpm 
	It will be generated in:
		/var/tmp/silabs/rpmbuild/RPM/i386/cp210x-x.y.z-i.rpm
	where x.y.z-i is the current release number.
	
	5. Browse to the directory above containing the new rpm and run:
		rpm -Uvh cp210x-x.y.z-i.rpm
	where x.y.z-i is the current release number.
	
	6. This will install the driver if it is not already installed and up to date.
	Reboot the computer to complete the installation. (optional)


Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

2.6 Kernel
	- makerpm - only supports builds for the running kernel.
	- .spec - dependencies are broken.

2.4 Kernel
	- Built to support only 2.4.36 (the last release of 2.4 at the time of
	development).
	- makerpm - may require a root password if the following files are not in the
	/usr/lib/rpm directory:
		brp-java-repack-jars
		brp-python-bytecompile
		check-rpaths
		check-rpaths-worker
	- .spec - dependencies are broken.
	- makerpm - only supports builds for the kernel linked to by /usr/src/linux-2.4
	is hard coded too. KERNELDIR is defined in Rules.make on line 17:
		KERNELDIR = /home/user/linux-2.x.y
	- cp210x.h - path to usb-serial.h is hardcoded.
